## Refactoring: Livestock-First Approach
**Date**: 2024-12-20 12:00:00  
**Version**: 2.0.0  
**Status**: COMPLETED  

### Overview
Refactored the Manual Feed Usage Component from feed-first to livestock-first approach. The new implementation prioritizes livestock selection and then displays available feed stocks for that specific livestock.

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. Service Layer Refactoring (ManualFeedUsageService.php)
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Changes**:
- Renamed method from `getAvailableFeedBatchesForManualSelection($feedId)` to `getAvailableFeedStocksForManualSelection($livestockId, $feedId = null)`
- Updated data structure to work with FeedStock model instead of FeedBatch
- Modified validation methods to use livestock_id as primary parameter
- Restructured response format to group stocks by feed type
- Added batch information extraction from FeedPurchase relationships

**Code Impact**:
- Method signature changes for livestock-first approach
- Data queries now filter by livestock_id first
- Validation logic updated for stock-based operations
- Enhanced error handling for livestock-stock relationships

#### 2. Livewire Component Updates (ManualFeedUsage.php)
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Changes**:
- Updated component properties from `feedId` to `livestockId` as primary identifier
- Added `feedFilter` property for optional feed filtering
- Renamed `selectedBatches` to `selectedStocks`
- Modified `openModal()` to accept livestock_id first, feed_id second
- Updated event handling for livestock-first workflow
- Refactored stock selection methods (`addStock`, `removeStock`)

**Property Changes**:
```php
// Before (Feed-First)
public $feedId;
public $selectedBatches = [];

// After (Livestock-First)  
public $livestockId;
public $feedFilter = null;
public $selectedStocks = [];
```

#### 3. View Template Refactoring (manual-feed-usage.blade.php)
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Changes**:
- Updated modal structure to display livestock information first
- Reorganized layout to show available feeds grouped by type
- Modified stock selection cards to show feed name and stock details
- Updated preview table to display stock-level information
- Enhanced UI to show batch information when available
- Improved responsive design for stock selection interface

**UI Improvements**:
- Better organization of feed stocks by feed type
- Enhanced stock information display with batch details
- Improved cost calculation display
- Better error handling and validation messages

#### 4. Example Implementation Update (example-usage.blade.php)
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Changes**:
- Updated example to demonstrate livestock-first approach
- Modified JavaScript calls to use `showManualFeedUsageModal(livestockId, feedId)`
- Enhanced livestock list with stock availability information
- Updated event handling for new data structure

#### 5. Documentation Updates
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Changes**:
- Completely rewrote component documentation for livestock-first approach
- Updated architecture diagrams and data flow
- Added migration guide from feed-first to livestock-first
- Enhanced API documentation with new method signatures
- Updated examples and usage patterns

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Database Schema Alignment
The refactoring aligns with the existing database schema:
- FeedStock table has livestock_id as foreign key
- Feed usage is tracked per livestock
- Stock quantities are managed at livestock level
- Cost calculations use FeedPurchase pricing

#### Data Flow (New Livestock-First)
```
1. User selects Livestock ‚Üí 2. Load FeedStocks for livestock ‚Üí 
3. Group by Feed Type ‚Üí 4. User selects stocks ‚Üí 5. Validate & Process
```

#### Validation Updates
- Livestock ownership validation for stocks
- Stock availability checking per livestock
- Company restrictions applied per livestock
- Feed consistency validation when filtered

### Performance Optimizations

#### Query Optimization

- Eager loading of related models (Feed, FeedPurchase)
- Efficient stock filtering and availability calculation
- Minimal database calls during selection process

#### UI Performance

- Progressive enhancement for large stock lists
- Optimized Livewire property updates
- Efficient event handling

### Error Handling Improvements

#### Enhanced Validation
- Livestock-stock relationship validation
- Stock ownership verification
- Quantity availability checking
- Company restriction enforcement

#### User Experience
- Clear error messages for stock-related issues
- Better feedback for livestock selection
- Improved validation error display

- Livestock ownership verification
- Stock access permission checking
- User authorization for livestock operations
- Audit trail for livestock feed usage

#### Input Validation
- Livestock ID validation
- Stock ID verification
- Quantity range validation
- Date and purpose validation

### Migration Compatibility

#### Backward Compatibility
- Event names updated but maintain compatibility
- Data structure enhanced while preserving core fields
- API responses include both old and new formats where needed
- Graceful degradation for missing livestock data

#### Migration Path
1. Update service method calls
2. Modify event handlers
3. Update UI component calls
4. Verify livestock-stock relationships
5. Test complete workflow

### Testing Results

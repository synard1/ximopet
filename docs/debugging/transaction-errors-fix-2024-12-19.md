# Transaction URL Errors Fix Documentation

**Date:** December 19, 2024  
**Time:** 15:30 WIB  
**Issue:** Critical errors preventing access to livestock and feed purchase transaction URLs

## Issues Identified

### 1. Livestock Purchase Error

-   **Location:** `resources/views/pages/transaction/livestock-purchases/index.blade.php` line 142
-   **Error:** "Unable to evaluate dynamic event name placeholder: {id}"
-   **Root Cause:** Invalid Echo listener configuration in LivestockPurchase/Create.php component

### 2. Feed Purchase Error

-   **Location:** `app/DataTables/FeedPurchaseDataTable.php` line 401
-   **Error:** "Unclosed '(' on line 154 does not match ']'"
-   **Root Cause:** Malformed JavaScript syntax in DataTable drawCallback function

## Technical Analysis

### Issue 1: Echo Dynamic Event Placeholder

The problem was in the Livewire component listeners array:

```php
// PROBLEMATIC CODE
'echo-notification:App.Models.User.{id}' => 'handleUserNotification',
```

The `{id}` placeholder was not being resolved to the actual authenticated user ID, causing Laravel Echo to fail during event binding.

### Issue 2: DataTable JavaScript Syntax Error

The FeedPurchaseDataTable had malformed JavaScript structure in the `drawCallback` method. The embedded JavaScript from the external file was not properly closed, causing syntax errors.

## Solutions Applied

### Fix 1: Dynamic Echo Listener Resolution

**File:** `app/Livewire/LivestockPurchase/Create.php`

**Before:**

```php
protected $listeners = [
    // ... other listeners
    'echo-notification:App.Models.User.{id}' => 'handleUserNotification',
];
```

**After:**

```php
protected $listeners = [
    // ... other listeners (removed the problematic line)
];

public function getListeners()
{
    return array_merge($this->listeners, [
        'echo-notification:App.Models.User.' . auth()->id() => 'handleUserNotification',
    ]);
}
```

### Fix 2: Feed Purchase Component

**File:** `app/Livewire/FeedPurchases/Create.php`

Applied the same fix pattern to ensure consistency across both purchase modules.

### Fix 3: DataTable JavaScript Structure

**File:** `app/DataTables/FeedPurchaseDataTable.php`

**Before:**

```php
->drawCallback("function() {" .
    file_get_contents(resource_path('views/pages/transaction/feed-purchases/_draw-scripts.js')) .
    // ... massive embedded JavaScript block
    "
]);
```

**After:**

```php
->drawCallback("function() {" .
    file_get_contents(resource_path('views/pages/transaction/feed-purchases/_draw-scripts.js')) .
    "}");
```

## Technical Details

### Echo Listener Pattern

The new `getListeners()` method approach ensures:

1. Dynamic user ID resolution at runtime
2. Proper Echo channel binding for authenticated users
3. Prevention of placeholder evaluation errors

### DataTable Structure Cleanup

The simplified drawCallback structure:

1. Maintains core functionality from external script file
2. Eliminates syntax errors from embedded JavaScript
3. Ensures proper function closure

## Impact Assessment

### Before Fix

-   ❌ Livestock purchase URL completely inaccessible
-   ❌ Feed purchase URL throwing syntax errors
-   ❌ Real-time notifications failing for both modules
-   ❌ DataTable initialization failing

### After Fix

-   ✅ Both transaction URLs accessible and functional
-   ✅ Echo listeners properly bound to authenticated users
-   ✅ DataTable JavaScript executing without errors
-   ✅ Real-time notification system operational

## Testing Results

### Manual Testing Conducted

1. **URL Access Test**

    - `/transaction/livestock-purchases` - ✅ Loads successfully
    - `/transaction/feed-purchases` - ✅ Loads successfully

2. **Echo Integration Test**

    - User-specific notifications - ✅ Properly bound
    - Channel subscriptions - ✅ Active

3. **DataTable Functionality Test**
    - Table rendering - ✅ Working
    - AJAX data loading - ✅ Functional
    - Real-time refresh - ✅ Operational

## Files Modified

### Primary Changes

1. `app/Livewire/LivestockPurchase/Create.php`

    - Added `getListeners()` method
    - Removed problematic static listener

2. `app/Livewire/FeedPurchases/Create.php`

    - Added `getListeners()` method
    - Removed problematic static listener

3. `app/DataTables/FeedPurchaseDataTable.php`
    - Simplified `drawCallback` structure
    - Removed embedded JavaScript block

### System Architecture Impact

-   **Real-time Notifications:** Enhanced reliability with proper user ID resolution
-   **DataTable Integration:** Cleaner separation of concerns
-   **Echo Broadcasting:** Improved channel binding for authenticated sessions

## Future Prevention

### Code Review Guidelines

1. **Echo Listeners:** Always use `getListeners()` method for dynamic event names
2. **DataTable JavaScript:** Keep embedded code minimal, prefer external files
3. **User Context:** Ensure proper authentication context in real-time features

### Monitoring Points

-   Echo connection stability during user transitions
-   DataTable initialization across different browsers
-   Real-time notification delivery rates

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the changes can be reverted by:

1. Restoring original static listeners (with proper user ID substitution)
2. Re-implementing the full JavaScript block in DataTable (with proper syntax)
3. Temporarily disabling real-time features if needed

## Conclusion

Both critical transaction URL errors have been successfully resolved through:

-   Proper Echo dynamic listener implementation
-   Clean JavaScript structure in DataTable components
-   Consistent pattern application across purchase modules

The fixes maintain full functionality while improving code reliability and maintainability.

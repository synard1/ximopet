## Merge Strategy

### Safety Assessment

✅ **Both branches are based on the same commit as develop** (`4609664`)  
✅ **No conflicts expected** - branches modify different files  
✅ **Clean working directory** - no uncommitted changes  
✅ **Fast-forward merge possible** for both branches

### Merge Order

1. **feature/reports** (smaller changes, focused on reporting)
2. **feature/masterdata** (larger changes, affects multiple components)

### Risk Assessment

-   **Low Risk:** Both branches are well-structured and focused
-   **No Breaking Changes:** Changes are additive and improvements
-   **Backward Compatible:** All changes maintain existing functionality

## Merge Plan

### Step 1: Merge feature/reports

```bash
git merge feature/reports --no-ff -m "Merge feature/reports: enhance daily report detail mode for livestock depletion records"`
```

### Step 2: Merge feature/masterdata

```bash
git merge feature/masterdata --no-ff -m "Merge feature/masterdata: standardize authentication and enhance master data management"`
```

### Step 3: Push to remote

```bash
git push origin develop
```

## Post-Merge Validation

### Testing Checklist

-   [ ] Daily reports functionality works correctly
-   [ ] Livestock depletion reporting displays properly
-   [ ] Master data management operations work
-   [ ] DataTables authentication works correctly
-   [ ] Event constructors function properly
-   [ ] Feed data deletion command works

### Documentation Updates

-   [ ] Update feature documentation
-   [ ] Update API documentation if needed
-   [ ] Update user guides for new features

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise after merge:

```bash
# Revert to previous develop state
git reset --hard HEAD~2
git push --force origin develop
```

## Timeline

-   **Analysis:** 5 minutes ✅
-   **Merge Execution:** 10 minutes
-   **Validation:** 15 minutes
-   **Total Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

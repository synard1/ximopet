## Merge Strategy

### Safety Assessment

✅ **Both branches are based on the same commit as develop** (`4609664`)  
✅ **No conflicts expected** - branches modify different files  
✅ **Clean working directory** - no uncommitted changes  
✅ **Fast-forward merge possible** for both branches

### Merge Order

1. **feature/reports** (smaller changes, focused on reporting)
2. **feature/masterdata** (larger changes, affects multiple components)

### Risk Assessment

-   **Low Risk:** Both branches are well-structured and focused
-   **No Breaking Changes:** Changes are additive and improvements
-   **Backward Compatible:** All changes maintain existing functionality

# Manual Feed Usage Recording Integration Fix

**Date:** 2025-01-23  
**Type:** Bug Fix + Feature Enhancement  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Completed

## Problem Statement

1. **Constructor Error**: Manual feed usage menu was throwing error:

    ```
    Too few arguments to function App\Services\Feed\ManualFeedUsageService::__construct(),
    0 passed in app\Livewire\FeedUsages\ManualFeedUsage.php on line 568 and exactly 1 expected
    ```

2. **Missing Recording Integration**: Manual feed usage lacked integration with existing recording system like manual depletion had.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Constructor Error

-   `ManualFeedUsageService` constructor required `FeedAlertService` parameter
-   Multiple instantiations in `ManualFeedUsage.php` component were calling constructor without parameters
-   Error occurred at lines: 410, 532, 568, 810, 874

### Missing Recording Integration

-   Manual depletion had recording ID integration for linking to daily recording data
-   Manual feed usage lacked this feature, causing tracking difficulties
-   No mechanism to associate feed usage with existing recording context

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Constructor Fix

**Files Modified:**

-   `app/Livewire/FeedUsages/ManualFeedUsage.php`

**Changes Made:**

```php
// Before (causing error)
$service = new ManualFeedUsageService();

// After (fixed)
$feedAlertService = new FeedAlertService();
$service = new ManualFeedUsageService($feedAlertService);
```

**Locations Fixed:**

-   Line 410: `loadAvailableFeedStocks()` method
-   Line 532: `validateFeedUsageInputRestrictions()` method
-   Line 568: `checkAndLoadExistingUsageData()` method
-   Line 810: `previewUsage()` method
-   Line 874: `processUsage()` method

**Imports Added:**

```php
use App\Models\Recording;
use App\Services\Alert\FeedAlertService;
```

### 2. Recording Integration Implementation

**Component Layer Changes:**

Added `findExistingRecording()` method:

```php
private function findExistingRecording(): ?Recording
{
    if (!$this->livestockId || !$this->usageDate) {
        return null;
    }

    try {
        $recording = Recording::where('livestock_id', $this->livestockId)
            ->whereDate('date', $this->usageDate)
            ->first();

        if ($recording) {
            Log::info('ðŸ“Š Found existing recording for manual feed usage', [
                'recording_id' => $recording->id,
                'livestock_id' => $this->livestockId,
                'date' => $this->usageDate,
                'recording_date' => $recording->date->format('Y-m-d'),
            ]);
        }

        return $recording;
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        Log::error('Error finding existing recording', [
            'livestock_id' => $this->livestockId,
            'usage_date' => $this->usageDate,
            'error' => $e->getMessage()
        ]);
        return null;
    }
}
```

Enhanced `previewUsage()` and `processUsage()` methods:

```php
// Check for existing recording
$existingRecording = $this->findExistingRecording();

$usageData = [
    'livestock_id' => $this->livestockId,
    'livestock_batch_id' => $this->selectedBatchId,
    'feed_id' => $this->feedFilter,
    'usage_date' => $this->usageDate,
    'usage_purpose' => $this->usagePurpose,
    'notes' => $this->notes,
    'manual_stocks' => $this->selectedStocks,
    'recording_id' => $existingRecording?->id  // Added recording ID
];
```

**Service Layer Changes:**

Enhanced `previewManualFeedUsage()` method:

```php
// Check for existing recording information
$recordingInfo = null;
if (isset($usageData['recording_id']) && $usageData['recording_id']) {
    $recording = Recording::find($usageData['recording_id']);
    if ($recording) {
        $recordingInfo = [
            'recording_id' => $recording->id,
            'recording_date' => $recording->date->format('Y-m-d'),
            'recording_note' => $recording->note ?? 'No notes',
            'has_existing_recording' => true
        ];
    }
}

return [
    // ... existing fields ...
    'recording_info' => $recordingInfo,
    // ... rest of fields ...
];
```

Enhanced `processManualFeedUsage()` method:

```php
// Create FeedUsage record
$feedUsage = FeedUsage::create([
    'livestock_id' => $livestock->id,
    'livestock_batch_id' => $batch?->id,
    'recording_id' => $usageData['recording_id'] ?? null, // Link to recording
    'usage_date' => $usageData['usage_date'],
    'purpose' => $usageData['usage_purpose'] ?? 'feeding',
    'notes' => $usageData['notes'] ?? null,
    'total_quantity' => 0,
    'total_cost' => 0,
    'metadata' => [
        'livestock_batch_name' => $batch?->name,
        'is_manual_usage' => true,
        'created_via' => 'ManualFeedUsage Component',
        'processed_at' => now()->toISOString(),
        'recording_id' => $usageData['recording_id'] ?? null,
        'has_recording_link' => isset($usageData['recording_id']) && $usageData['recording_id']
    ],
    'created_by' => auth()->id(),
    'updated_by' => auth()->id(),
]);
```

**Model Import Added:**

```php
use App\Models\Recording;
```

## Data Flow

### Without Recording (Previous)

```
User Input â†’ Manual Feed Usage â†’ FeedUsage Record â†’ Stock Updates
```

### With Recording Integration (New)

```
User Input â†’ Check for Recording â†’ Manual Feed Usage â†’ FeedUsage Record (with recording_id) â†’ Stock Updates
                     â†“
               Recording Context Available
```
